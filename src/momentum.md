# Momentum

All object that is in motion have momentum. The formula for momentum is:

\\[p = mv\\]

\\(p\\) is momentum (\\(kg\cdot m/s\\))<br>
\\(m\\) is the object's mass (\\(kg\\))<br>
\\(v\\) is the object's velocity (\\(m/s\\)

Momentum is alway in the same direction as the velocity

### Impulse

The equation for impulse or change in momentum is:

\\[I = m(v_f - v_i)\\]
or
\\[I = m\Delta v\\]

\\(I\\) is impulse (\\(Ns\\))<br>
\\(m\\) is the object's mass (\\(kg\\))<br>
\\(v_f\\) is the object's final velocity (\\(m/s\\))<br>
\\(v_i\\) is the object initial velocity (\\(m/s\\))

Another formula for impulse is:

\\[I = Ft\\]

\\(I\\) is the impulse (\\(Ns\\))<br>
\\(F\\) is the applies force (\\(N\\))<br>
\\(t\\) is the time (\\(s\\))
