# Definition

**Free Body Diagram** is a diagram use to show force that is acting on a object.

**Frame of Reference**: The point of view of which motion is observe and describe. Also POV (Point of View)<br>
**Relative Motion**: Motion of an object relative to a frame of reference.<br>
**Fixed FOR**: FOR from a stationary object.<br>
**Moving FOR**: FOR from a moving object.<br>

**Force**: A push or a pull on an object.<br>
**Net Force**: Total force act on a object.<br>
**Constant Velocity**: Velocity that is not changing (no acceleration).<br>
**Inertia**: An object tendency to change in motion (more inertia mean harder to move).<br>

**Weight** is the object mass in relation to the gravitational force that act on the object.<br>
**Applies Force** is a push or pull force that is applies onto a object either by a person or another object.<br>
**Tension** is the force that an object, such as a rope, rubber band or spring, transmits when it is stretches.<br>
**Pulleys** can be use to change a tension force direction but not magnitude.<br>

**Friction** is the force that act on object when 2 surface is in contact.<br>
**Static friction** is the force that act on a 2 surface when they are at rest.<br>
**Kinematic friction** is the force that act on a 2 surface when they are at moving.<br>

**Momentum** is defined as the quantity of motion of a moving body.<br>
**Impulse** is the object change in momentum.<br>

**Work** is the transfer of energy.<br>
**Power** is the rate of which work is being done.<br>
**Kinetic energy** is the energy that an object has because it is in motion.<br>
**Potential energy** is defined as the energy stored by an object because of its position or state.<br>
