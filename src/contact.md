# Contact

## Applied Force

Applies Force have the symbol \\(F_a\\)

## Spring Force

> When a force is applies to a spring the spring will stretch or compress. The counteractive force that is require for the spring to go back is call the **restoring force**.

The spring force relationship is call the Hook's Law.

\\[F = −kx\\]

\\(F\\) is the restoring force (\\(N\\)).<br>
\\(k\\) is the spring constant (this value varies depending on the spring's material).<br>
\\(x\\) is the amount of deformation/displacement observed (\\(m)\\).

## Tension

Tension is always directly along the rope or alike object, the force is also alway a pull force.

## Normal

> When an object is in contact with a surface the surface push back on the object in the normal direction of the surface, this is the **contact force**.
> Contact force is the force that stop object from phasing through each other.

Normal force can be calculated using the weight formula, but it will be the inverse of the weight:

\\[N = gm\\]
or on earth it simply
\\[N = 9.8m\\]

\\(N\\) is the normal force (\\(N\\))<br>
\\(g\\) is the gravitational constant (\\(m/s^2\\))<br>
\\(m\\) is the object mass (\\(kg\\))

## Friction

The symbol for friction is \\(F_f\\). Friction is dependent on the surface in contact and the magnitude of the force that push the surface together or the [normal force](#Normal). The size of the surface does not change friction.

### Static Friction

For an object to start moving you must overcome the static friction

### Kinematic Friction

To keep an object moving you must overcome or be equal to the kinematic friction. The kinematic friction is alway less than the static friction.

The formula for Kinematic friction force is:

\\[ F_k = \mu_kN \\]

\\(F_k\\) is the kinematic friction force (\\(N\\))  
\\(\mu_k\\) is the coefficient of kinematic friction, this measure the roughness of the surface  
\\(N\\) is the normal force (\\(N\\))
