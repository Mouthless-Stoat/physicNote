# Newton's Law of Motion

> 1. An object with no net force remain at rest or continue in motion with constant velocity

If a frame of reference is accelerating, it is **NOT** an inertial frame of reference. If a object have net force add up to 0 the object is not accelerating.

> 2. The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force on it.

If you push an object hard it will accelerate faster, if the object is heavier you need more force to accelerate it to the same rate.

Equation for force:

\\[ F = ma \\]

\\(F\\) is the force (\\(N\\))<br>
\\(m\\) is the object mass (\\(kg\\))<br>
\\(a\\) is the object acceleration (\\(m/s^2\\))

> 3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

When something is push the object pushes back with the same force in opposite direction. Object is still able to move because of the multiple action pair that an object can be a part of
