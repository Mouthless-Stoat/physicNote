# Work and Energy

## Work

> Work is done when a force cause an object to move.

Formula for work is:

\\[ W = Fd cos(\theta)\\]

\\(W\\) is the work done (\\(J\\))<br>
\\(F\\) is the force (\\(N\\))<br>
\\(d\\) is the displacement (\\(m\\))<br>
\\(\theta\\) is the angle between the displacement vector and force vector (deg)

If the force is in the same direction with the displacement we do maximum positive work and can use \\(W = Fd\\).<br>
If the force is in the opposite direction with the displacement we do maximum negative work and can use \\(W = -Fd\\).<br>
If the force is in perpendicular with the displacement we do no positive work and can use.

In a f-d graph the area under the curve is the work done

## Power

Formula for power is:

\\[P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}\\]
or
\\[P = \frac{W_f - W_I}{t}\\]
or
\\[P = Fv\\]

\\(P\\) is the rate (\\(W\\))

## Kinetic Energy

The formula for kinetic energy is:

\\[K = \frac{mv^2}{2}\\]

\\(K\\) is the kinetic energy (\\(J\\))<br>
\\(m\\) is the object mass (\\(kg\\))<br>
\\(v\\) is the object velocity (\\(m/s\\))

Kinetic energy is also equal to the amount of work done (\\(W = K\\) or \\(Fd cos(\theta) = \frac{mv^2}{2}\\))

## Potential Energy

The formula for gravitational potential energy is:

\\[ U_g = gmh\\]
or
\\[ U_g = 9.8mh\\]
or
\\[ U_g = F_wh\\]

\\(U_g\\) is the gravitational potential energy (\\(J\\))<br>
\\(m\\) is the object mass (\\(kg\\))<br>
\\(g\\) is the gravitational constant (\\(m/s\\))<br>
\\(h\\) is the height (\\(m\\))<br>
\\(F_w\\) is the object weight (\\(N\\))
