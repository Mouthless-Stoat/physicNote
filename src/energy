# Work and Energy

## Work

> Work is done when a force cause an object to move.

Formula for work is:

\\[ W = Fd cos(\theta)\\]

W is the work done (J)  
F is the force (N)  
d is the displacement (m)
Î¸ is the angle between the displacement vector and force vector (deg)

If the force is in the same direction with the displacement we do maximum positive work and can use \\(W = Fd\\)  
If the force is in the opposite direction with the displacement we do maximum negative work and can use \\(W = -Fd\\)  
If the force is in perpendicular with the displacement we do no positive work and can use.

In a f-d graph the area under the curve is the work done

## Power

Formula for power is:

\\[ P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} \\]
or
\\[ P = \frac{W_f - W_I}{t} \\]
or
\\[ P = Fv \\]

P is the rate (W)

## Kinetic Energy

The formula for kinetic energy is:

\\[ K = \frac{mv^2}{2} \\]

K is the kinetic energy (J)  
m is the object mass (kg)  
v is the object velocity (m/s)

Kinetic energy is also equal to the amount of work done (\\(W = K\\) or \\(Fd cos(\theta) = \frac{mv^2}{2}\\))

## Potential Energy

The formula for gravitational potential energy is:

\\[ U_g = gmh\\]
or
\\[ U_g = 9.8mh\\]
or
\\[ U_g = F_wh\\]

\\(U_g\\) is the gravitational potential energy (J)  
m is the object mass (kg)  
g is the gravitational constant (m/s)  
h is the height (m)  
\\(F_w\\) is the object weight (N)
