# Kinematics

## Definition

To measure and describe a object motion we must compare it to a frame of reference or relative to something.

# Dynamic

Dynamic is the studies of force that change motion of an object

## Newton law of Motion:

1. An object with no net force remain at rest or continue in motion with constant velocity

If a frame of reference is accelerating, it is **NOT** an inertial frame of reference.

2. The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force on it.

If you push an object hard it will accelerate faster, if the object is heavier you need more force to accelerate it to the same rate.

Equation for force:

\\[ F = ma \\]

F is the force (N)  
m is the object mass (kg)  
a is the object acceleration (\\(m/s^2\\))

3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

When something is push the object pushes back with the same force in opposite direction. Object is still able to move because of the multiple action pair that an object can be a part of

## Force

### Action at a Distance force

Force that a act on an object without touching it

#### Gravitational Force

The gravitational force exerted on an object by the Earth (or another planet) is known as its weight. The weight is calculate by multiplying the object mass by the gravitational acceleration it is on.

\\[ F_w = gm \\]
or on earth it simply
\\[ F_w = 9.8m \\]

While mass is the amount of matter it it make out of.

Weight is a vector quantity that have both magnitude and direction, most of the time mass will be downward.

### Contact Force

#### Applies Force

Applies Force have the symbol \\(F_a\\)

#### Spring Force

> When a force is applies to a spring the spring will stretch or compress. The counteractive force that is require for the spring to go back is call the **restoring force**.

The spring force relationship is call the Hook's Law.

\\[ F = −kx \\]

F is the restoring force (N).  
k is the spring constant (this value varies depending on the spring's material).  
x is the amount of deformation/displacement observed (m).

#### Tension

Tension is always directly along the rope or alike object, the force is also alway a pull force.

#### Normal Force

> When an object is in contact with a surface the surface push back on the object in the normal direction of the surface, this is the **contact force**.
> Contact force is the force that stop object from phasing through each other.

Normal force can be calculated using the weight formula:

\\[ N = gm \\]
or on earth it simply
\\[ N = 9.8m \\]

N is the normal force (N) (also the weight)  
g is the gravitational constant (\\(m/s^2\\))  
m is the object mass (kg)

### Friction

The symbol for friction is \\(F_f\\). Friction is dependent on the surface in contact and the magnitude of the force that push the surface together or the [normal force](#normal-force). The size of the surface does not change friction.

#### Type of Friction

##### Static

For an object to start moving you must overcome the static friction

##### Kinematic

To keep an object moving you must overcome or be equal to the kinematic friction. The kinematic friction is alway less than the static friction.

The formula for Kinematic friction force is:

\\[ F_k = \mu_kN \\]

\\(F_k\\) is the kinematic friction force (N)  
\\(\mu_k\\) is the coefficient of kinematic friction, this measure the roughness of the surface  
N is the normal force (N)

## Momentum

All object that is in motion have momentum. The formula for momentum is:

\\[ p = mv \\]

p is momentum (kg\\(\cdot\\)m/s)  
m is the object's mass (kg)  
v is the object's velocity (m/s)

Momentum is alway in the same direction as the velocity

### Impulse

The equation for impulse or change in momentum is:

\\[ I = m(v_f - v_i) \\]
or
\\[ I = m\Delta v \\]

I is impulse (Ns)  
m is the object's mass (kg)  
\\(v_f\\) is the object's final velocity (m/s)  
\\(v_i\\) is the object initial velocity (m/s)

Another formula for impulse is:

\\[ I = Ft\\]

I is the impulse (Ns)  
F is the applies force (N)  
t is the time (s)

# Work and Energy

## Work

> Work is done when a force cause an object to move.

Formula for work is:

\\[ W = Fd cos(\theta)\\]

W is the work done (J)  
F is the force (N)  
d is the displacement (m)
θ is the angle between the displacement vector and force vector (deg)

If the force is in the same direction with the displacement we do maximum positive work and can use \\(W = Fd\\)  
If the force is in the opposite direction with the displacement we do maximum negative work and can use \\(W = -Fd\\)  
If the force is in perpendicular with the displacement we do no positive work and can use.

In a f-d graph the area under the curve is the work done

## Power

Formula for power is:

\\[ P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} \\]
or
\\[ P = \frac{W_f - W_I}{t} \\]
or
\\[ P = Fv \\]

P is the rate (W)

## Kinetic Energy

The formula for kinetic energy is:

\\[ K = \frac{mv^2}{2} \\]

K is the kinetic energy (J)  
m is the object mass (kg)  
v is the object velocity (m/s)

Kinetic energy is also equal to the amount of work done (\\(W = K\\) or \\(Fd cos(\theta) = \frac{mv^2}{2}\\))

## Potential Energy

The formula for gravitational potential energy is:

\\[ U_g = gmh\\]
or
\\[ U_g = 9.8mh\\]
or
\\[ U_g = F_wh\\]

\\(U_g\\) is the gravitational potential energy (J)  
m is the object mass (kg)  
g is the gravitational constant (m/s)  
h is the height (m)  
\\(F_w\\) is the object weight (N)
