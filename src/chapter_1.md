# Work and Energy

## Work

> Work is done when a force cause an object to move.

Formula for work is:

\\[ W = Fd cos(\theta)\\]

W is the work done (J)  
F is the force (N)  
d is the displacement (m)
θ is the angle between the displacement vector and force vector (deg)

If the force is in the same direction with the displacement we do maximum positive work and can use \\(W = Fd\\)  
If the force is in the opposite direction with the displacement we do maximum negative work and can use \\(W = -Fd\\)  
If the force is in perpendicular with the displacement we do no positive work and can use.

In a f-d graph the area under the curve is the work done

## Power

Formula for power is:

\\[ P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} \\]
or
\\[ P = \frac{W_f - W_I}{t} \\]
or
\\[ P = Fv \\]

P is the rate (W)

## Kinetic Energy

The formula for kinetic energy is:

\\[ K = \frac{mv^2}{2} \\]

K is the kinetic energy (J)  
m is the object mass (kg)  
v is the object velocity (m/s)

Kinetic energy is also equal to the amount of work done (\\(W = K\\) or \\(Fd cos(\theta) = \frac{mv^2}{2}\\))

## Potential Energy

The formula for gravitational potential energy is:

\\[ U_g = gmh\\]
or
\\[ U_g = 9.8mh\\]
or
\\[ U_g = F_wh\\]

\\(U_g\\) is the gravitational potential energy (J)  
m is the object mass (kg)  
g is the gravitational constant (m/s)  
h is the height (m)  
\\(F_w\\) is the object weight (N)

# Equation

## Kinematics

Kinematic Equation:

\\[
\begin{align*}
d &= \frac{t(v_f + v_i)}{2}\\\\
v_f &= v_i + at\\\\
v_f^2 &= v_i^2 + 2ad\\\\
d &= d_i + v_it + \frac{at^2}{2}
\end{align*}
\\]

Heigh of an object: \\(h = v_it + \frac{gt^2}{2}\\)

Newton's Second Law: \\(F = ma\\)

Weight or gravitational force: \\(W = mg\\)

Hook's Law: \\(F = −kx\\)

Kinetic Friction: \\(F_f=\mu_kN\\) or \\(F_f=\mu_kmg\\)

## Tension 1 rope, 1 mass:

General form \\(T = m(a+g)\\)  
Not falling \\(T = W\\) or \\(T = mg\\)  
Known weight \\(T = W + \frac{aW}{g}\\)

## Tension 2 rope, 2 mass (only worry about the first rope which is being pull by 3 things):

General form: \\(T = (m_1+m_2)(a+g)\\)  
Not falling: \\(T = g(m_1+m_2)\\)

## Weight in a Elevator:

General form: \\(W_e = m(a+g)\\)  
With known weight: \\(W_e = W_g + \frac{aW}{g}\\)

## Atwood Machine:

Acceleration:
\\[a = g \frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}\\]  
\\(m_1\\) is the mass of the larger object. Or the object you want to calculate the acceleration  
Tension: \\(T = m_2(a+g)\\)

## Hanging blocks from a table:

\\[a = g \frac{(m_2 - \mu_km_1)}{m_1+m_2}\\]  
\\(m_2\\) is the object that is falling

## On a surface:

Acceleration: \\(a = \frac{F-\mu_kmg}{m}\\)  
Friction force: \\(\mu_kmg = F-am\\)  
coefficient : \\(\mu_k = \frac{F-am}{mg}\\)

Momentum: \\(q = mv\\)

## Momentum:

Impulse:

\\[
\begin{align*}
I &= m\Delta v\\\\
I &= m(v_f - v_i)\\\\
I &= Ft\\\\
\end{align*}
\\]

Mass: \\(m = \left|\frac{Ft}{\Delta v}\right|\\)  
Velocity: \\(v = \left|\frac{Ft}{m}\right|\\)  
Time: \\(t = \left|\frac{m\delta v}{F}\right|\\)  
Force: \\(F = \frac{m\delta v}{t}\\)

## Work and Energy:

Work: \\(W = Fdcos(\theta)\\)

Power:

\\[
\begin{align*}

\end{align*}

Base formula: \\(K = \frac{mv^2}{2}\\) or \\(K = Fd\\)  
Mass: \\(m = \frac{K}{2v^2}\\)  
Velocity: \\(v=\sqrt{\frac{2k}{m}}\\)

Displacement: \\(d = \frac{mv_f^2}{2F}\\)
