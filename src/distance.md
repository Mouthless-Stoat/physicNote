# Distance

Force that a act on an object without touching it. Of which there is only 1 we will learn about.

## Gravity

The gravitational force exerted on an object by the Earth (or another planet) is known as its weight. The weight is calculate by multiplying the object mass by the gravitational acceleration it is on.

\\[F_w = gm\\]
or on earth it simply
\\[F_w = 9.8m\\]

While mass is the amount of matter it it make out of.

Weight is a vector quantity that have both magnitude and direction, most of the time weight will be downward.
